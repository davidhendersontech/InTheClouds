Ever felt like all the tasks you need to get done are just passing you by? Now you can visualize that!

## Setup
1. Install npm packages
``` npm install ```
2. Run json server
``` json-server --watch db.json```
3. Run the react app
``` npm start ```

The steps must be done in this order or else !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### About
This was a quick project to learn about react.js and how to deal with state/props of components.
Hopefully it'll make you a bit more zen (unless you have 1000 tasks and then you won't even be able to read one)
